# Modern JavaScript Patterns

In the world of scalable JavaScript, when we say modular, we often mean it's composed of a set of highly decoupled (separated) pieces of functionality stored in modules.

Currently Javascript doesn't provide clean and organized way to import such modules so developers are left with variants like object literal patterns or module pattern.
Native solutions to this problems will come in ES Harmony(the next version of JavaScript) and the best thing is that we can start doing it today.

We are doing to look at three ways to write modular JavaScript:

- AMD
- CommonJS
- ES Harmony
